# About me <i class="fas fa-user"></i>  
 
I am a Research Analyst at the Social Analysis and Modelling Division at Statistics Canada and a Research Associate at the Centre for Advanced Research on Mental Health and Society. 

I hold a PhD and MA in Sociology, with a focus on social inequality and social psychology, and an Honours BA in Social Psychology. As a sociologist and social psychologist, my research explores how inequality shapes experiences in education, family life, and health. Whether I'm teaching in the classroom or conducting policy-relevant research, my aim is always the same: to bring clarity, compassion, and connection to complex social issues.

# Research

I explore how social and economic factors impact across the life course‚Äîespecially among vulnerable populations. I've conducted both quantitative and qualitative methodologies in my work. I currently use large longitudinal administrative data and national survey data to carry out my work.

# Life, Love & Laughter

A few reflections from life outside of academia‚Äîstories, thoughts, and maybe a recipe or two. 
I believe joy, humor, and storytelling make knowledge more human.
